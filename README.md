# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic In this challenge, we build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive in Titanic?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

This is a basic analysis of the Titanic data and visualization.
We used Random Forest for prediction. We reached 87% accuracy in train data and 78% on test data.
